## Lightweight Vape Comparison: Crave Onix vs DaVinci IQ

The DaVinci IQ has been that you can buy for just a little over two years now, as the Crave Onix from Australian-based Crave Vaporizers is merely about to drop!

Both devices have already been designed with ultimate discreetness and portability in mind, without skimping on flavor or cloud production like the totally underwhelming PAX 3 lightweight vape.

Flipping the lid off, there are a couple of big dissimilarities between your DaVinci IQ and the Crave Onix. The DaVinci IQ boasts a full-ceramic zirconia vapor path and comes equipped with dual, ultra-tough zirconia mouthpieces.

With the flat mouthpiece, you can vape discreetly on the run, while the extended mouthpiece makes sharing sessions just a little simpler and less intimate.

The Crave Onix includes a magnetic snap-on mouthpiece constructed from food-grade plastic. This mouthpiece possesses great airflow, but after a couple of long sessions, you'll spot the mouthpiece affecting flavor a bit more than that of the IQ.

Both units feature ceramic bottom-loading baking chambers for optimized flavor and a regular vaporization of your herbal blend.

Ceramic can usually get in any event, however, with the unit, it spent some time working well to produce a fantastic tasting vapor. The Crave Onix's chamber can be a little wider-arranged and allows for better airflow than that of the DaVinci IQ.

The IQ's ceramic zirconia heating pin attached to the hinge really helps to compact the chamber and vaporize it a bit more evenly. Both good points of get for a portable vape lover.

In what I'll only make reference to as a public display of affection from the Melbourne-based vape designers, the Crave Onix includes a remarkably comparable flavor chamber to that of the DaVinci IQ.

Crave's chamber is made of ceramic, as the shinier tube in the left is made up of clean ceramic zirconia. These chambers help to cool off the vapor, and add flavour when filled up with fresh herbs.

The DaVinci IQ comes with a removable 18650 battery which is often useful in extending the session. If you've a vaper that likes to take your product on trips for days at a time, then your DaVinci IQ could be the device for you.

That being said, it includes a battery life of roughly 60 a few minutes, which is very similar compared to that of the Crave Onix. Both devices include Micro-USB charging capabilities.

With an OLED screen for displaying battery life as well as set and actual temperature in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, the Crave Onix is a super user-friendly vaporizer.

Like the majority of portables, 5-clicks activates the device, and the alternate buttons can be used to switch up the temperature between 150'C (302'F) and 222'C (432'F).

The DaVinci also features full-spectrum digital temperature control and has a temp selection of 120'C (250'F) to 220'C (430'F).

You can adapt the temperature utilizing the buttons on these devices, or via the gadgets Bluetooth-enabled smartphone application. That is an ultra-premium feature that allows you to regulate temperature paths and receive the many out of your herb.

With their latest three releases, the Crave Cloud, Crave Quantum wax pen, and the Onix, Crave has stuck with the aesthetic grey and green theme linking with their Aussie Greenery tagline.

Included in the kit is:
- 1 x Crave Onix Vaporizer
- 1 x Packing Tool
- 1 x Micro USB Charging Cable
- 1 x Cleaning Brush
- User Manual

The Crave Onix is the Melbourne-based companies most premium product to day. I provide it an 8.5/10 overall, with a 9/10 for flavor and 8/10 for vapor production.

I've heard in good confidence that the initial chamber wall structure has been substituted with the one which is easier to tidy and operate so I have super large aspirations because of this vaporizer.

If you've not used to vaping, or a desktop vaper that's searching for an awesome lightweight to increase their collection, the Crave Onix may be the perfect gadget for you.

The DaVinci IQ comes with one of the coolest accessory packs I've ever come across. With the initial orange palette utilized through the entire kit, the very small boxes and unique gadgets are a great touch.

Contained in the kit is:
- 1 x DaVinci IQ Portable Vaporizer
- 1 x Keychain Tool
- 1 x Micro USB Charging Cable
- 1 x Plug-Style Washing Brush
- 1 x Herb Hold Can
- 1 x 3500mAh Battery
- 1 x Water Software Adapter/Mouthpiece Extender
- 10 x Alcohol Washing Wipes
- 1 x User Manual

In conditions of flavor, I supply the DaVinci IQ a 10/10. The 1st time I hit a packed chamber I was impressed at the sweet flavours that translated through. I'm a terpene fiend thus a vape with a great flavor profile can be an absolute must.

While the obvious vapor isn't at the level of claim, the Arizer Solo, this vape nonetheless blows great clouds and will drag a program out to last so long as ten minutes.

The DaVinci IQ may be the connoisseur vaper's weapon of preference and may make no compromises for flavor.
