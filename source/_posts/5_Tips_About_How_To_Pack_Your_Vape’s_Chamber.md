Enjoying an excellent session from your own vaporizer begins with the chamber. In the event that you don't pack your vape's chamber correctly you certainly won't be obtaining the virtually all out of your herbal remedies!

The chamber is actually your vape's fuel tank. It's where you put your herbs or focus, and generally carries a heating component or a metal screen.

This will differ according to whether you've by using a convection or conduction vaporizer. Conduction vapes, which usually are for liquid or oil, have an embedded heating aspect to atomize the dabs or eJuice within. 

Dry herb vaporizers make use of a convection heat or hybrid heating method to generate a vapor, which demands the heating element to be different from the herb chamber to ensure that it won't reason combustion. 

In this guide, we've put together five methods that will help to pack your vape's chamber properly time and time again. Take a look below!

## 5) Use Dosing Capsules

Dosing capsules are little metal containers that are being used to evenly dosage dry herbal products for a constant vaping experience. 

The Storz & Bickel Dosing Place (pictured above, box) contains 40 stainless steel dosing capsules for use with the Storz & Bickel Crafty & Mighty Portable Vaporizers.

I know a bunch of people that swear by these dosing capsules, since it allows you to transformation your vape's chamber quickly and in a mess-free fashion. 

Aside from building dosing and chamber swaps a breeze, these dosing capsules make certain that you are not putting an excessive amount of or inadequate herb into your chamber. 

By by using a dosing capsule you've sacrificing session length because of devoid of as large a chamber, but eventually you've prolonging the life of your vaporizer tenfold.

If you are having trouble figuring out how to pack your vape's chamber, take a glance in the VapeFuse shop to see if we inventory any that are appropriate for your device.

## 4) Don't Overfill or Underfill

The largest problem we see from persons having problems with their device stems from over-packing or under-packing their vape's chamber. 

Under-packing is noticeable. If you've not putting enough surface herb into the chamber you've likely to have issues pulling dense clouds of obvious vapor through.

A good rule of thumb is to covers the entirety of your device's screen to ensure that each tiny bit of air that's being pulled through is coming into contact with the herb. 

It's very good to pack your vape's chamber firmly, however, not aggressively. If you've having to drive it in, it's likely that you've tried to over-pack your vape's chamber which will result in a restricted pull and limit the airflow.

The same could be said of liquid pads, which are stainless steel chamber inserts used to atomize smaller amounts of concentrate.

These liquid pads can be great for making some flavorsome low-temp dabs, but if you've not adding plenty of concentrate you've not likely to get any visible vapor.

To be certain that you've making use of your liquid pad efficiently, you've going to need to pass on a thin sum of concentrate above the entirety of the small metal pad so that it can have some chance at atomizing.

## 3) Spread Your Blend Evenly

Spreading your herbs equally when you pack the vape's chamber is en par with certainly not over-filling or under-filling these devices. 

If you're utilizing a lumpy herb mix, surroundings pockets can form in the chamber which consequence is less vapor and extra oxygen being pulled through. 

If you look into the Haze Square Pro's chamber inserts above you'll start to see the huge amount of surroundings holes present in the chamber at any moment, and all of these should be accounted for with herb.

By spreading your dry herb mixture equally when you pack your vape's chamber, you've insuring for a steady blast of tasty vapor and an extended session.  

This practice counters any potential 'hot spots' which may be within the chamber that may char your herb and impart combustion-like flavors in to the vapor path.

## 2) Use Your Vape's Filling Aid

Most vaporizers nowadays, but especially the 'sidewinder' lightweight vapes like the Storz & Bickel Crafty & the Vivant Alternate (pictured over) all come built with filling aids.

A filling aid is often a funnel-shaped machine that slot machines directly over your vape's chamber and assists with the packing of your herbs. 

The filling aid really helps to improve the size of the opening of the chamber and reduce spillage and annoying build-up around the chambers opening. 

While it is pretty easy to overfill with the filling aid when you pack your vape's chamber, it's way simpler to rectify since you can simply scrape the surplus out onto the lip of the funnel. 

Utilizing a filling aid will result in a perfect chamber pack, and that's particularly true when you incorporate the filling help with a good quality herb grinder.

## 1) Grind your Herb

All the above tips are only applicable if you grind straight down your material! Through the use of ground herb instead of whole herb, you've ensuring for a straight draw, flavorsome obvious vapor, and a long session.

Herb grinders can be found in all different sizes and shapes, so it's vital that you research your facts before purchasing a grinder. 

The best grinder for use with a vaporizer may be the GrindeROO 4-piece Herb Grinder with aluminium alloy and zinc teeth for optimized crushing power. 

With the GrindeROO 4-Piece Grinder, you have something which will deliver you a consistent ground material again and again. 

That is essential when learning how exactly to pack your vape's chamber, since it removes the chance of hot spots and possible combustion. 

Like I said, a good session starts with an excellent chamber. If you follow these instruction lines you've going to benefit from the best sesh of your life! And that's a VapeFuse ensure.
