We recently copped three awesome new lightweight vapes from the dudes at Boundless Technology USA! 

These past couple of weeks we've been scrupulously testing the Boundless CFX, Boundless Tera, and Boundless CFV lightweight vapes, and have develop some outstanding discoveries.

<!-- more -->

The Boundless Technology type of lightweight vapes is super broad, featuring almost twelve initial and second generation portables, all in the original shade of black.

What I really like about the unit is that they've all flawlessly simple, yet have everything you need to obtain a mad session on!

Whole spectrum digital temp control, optimized flavor chambers, and super-simple maintenance are features of all three of the Boundless Technology portables, so now the sole question is, which is for you? 

## Boundless CFX Lightweight Vaporizer 

The Boundless CFX is obviously the most hyped and discussed of the three. It features a huge OLED screen on the front that is extremely detailed to the idea that it's aesthetically satisfying. 

In conditions of flavor, the Boundless CVX definitely takes the cake. It includes a HUGE ceramic-walled baking chamber with an embedded ceramic heat element and includes a flavor reminiscent of the DaVinci IQ. 

That's certainly saying something, mainly because the IQ took out 'Best Flavor' on our Top Weed Vapes 2018 shopping for guide. 

In terms of what comes included in the kit, you've getting an awesome starting deal with the Boundless CFX. 

The CFX comes equipped with both a wall charger and a Micro-USB charging cable, to ensure that wherever you are you will keep your battery loaded constantly!

Flavour connoisseurs rejoice. There's finally a vape that's acquired an enormous chamber that's been optimized for flavour, and this thing could keep you blowing for up to 15 minutes off an individual session. 

Look out for the Boundless CFX in the VapeFuse retail outlet! 

## Boundless Tera Portable Vape

If Boundless Technology were choosing optimized flavor with the CFX, the Boundless Tera has had them swap their focus to brute power!

The Boundless Tera blows denser vapor than any device I've run into. And that's genuinely saying something as that is, in its essence,  a full-convection portable. 

Equipped with 3 interchangeable mouthpieces designed for vaporization, the most recent release right from Boundless Technology is obviously the most superior of the three. 

If you fancy yourself as somewhat of a vaping connoisseur, the Boundless Tera should be in your scope.

This vape is slightly without flavor, especially when compared to Boundless CFX, but if you're trying to help make the switch from smoking and want a vape that's going to blow you away, Boundless Technology has an offering for you. 

With the Boundless Tera, you've obtaining a powerhouse with an excellent battery, a decent-sized chamber, and an awesome kit. 

The Boundless Tera is going to hit the VapeFuse store! Register with the mailing list to maintain with all our different drops. 

## Boundless CFV

Boundless Technology offers several entry-level lightweight vaporizers that are even more suitable for beginners than vaping connoisseurs, on the other hand, the Boundless CFV is normally a little more elaborate than most. 

If you've ever been fortunate to test the Flowermate Swift Pro Lightweight Vape, you'll know about the lovely, full-convection vapor provided by the Boundless CFV. 

While I come across the Swift Pro to have a superior vapor, that is largely owing to the borosilicate glass chamber insert that really helps to deliver a far more pure type of vapor, however the CFV, because of its price, can be an absolute steal!

The Boundless CFV was the to begin the Boundless Technology portables that I tried out, and I found a little herb goes a long way with this model. 

Including a filling assist in the kit would be an incredible way to increase the usability a little bit, but in addition to that, it comes in an ideal little package with everything you might need to get your vape upon. 

If you're searching for a low-expense high-value portable vaporizer, keep an eye out for the Boundless CVF Portable Vape in the VapeFuse retailer! 

## The Chambers

Big baking chambers are available in each one of the Boundless Technology lightweight vapes. The Boundless CFX can take the cake right here, with a chamber twice how big is the other two. 

The Boundless Tera & CFV come built with stainless steel chambers, as the CFX's ceramic chamber helps optimize it for flavor. 

In conditions of mouthpieces, the Boundless CFV and CFX both come equipped with food-grade plastic material sidewinder style mouthpieces, while the Tera includes a number of interchangeable mouthpieces, including plastic material, glass, and an aluminium alloy water pipe adapter. 

## The Display

A whole lot of work has truly gone into the digital shows with these models, especially the Boundless CFX. 

The CFX's huge OLED screen is reminiscent of an odometer, with all the info you could ever need, including session timer, electric battery life, and set/actual temp. 

With the Tera, you've obtaining a simple yet user-friendly display, as the CFV could do with a little brightness to light that dull display. 

## Water Pipe Attachment

If you've partial to enjoying your vapor through a cup water pipe, you'll maintain luck with two out of three of the Boundless Technology line of portables. 

Both Boundless Tera and Boundless CFV come built with aluminium alloy water pipe adapters that are appropriate for both 14mm and 18.8mm joints. 

The Tera, in particular, works amazingly through the water pipe. Its huge output is certainly cooled to perfection, providing you the opportunity to take far much larger hits than you normally would be able to. 

While I'm not normally a admirer of using your dry out herb vaporizer to buyer concentrates, the Boundless Tera and CFX give you that option, if you so please.

The Tera's liquid pad is HUGE!! This little puck could easily endure to 0.3 of a good gram of concentrates, as the Boundless CFX's big concentrate pod is created for both liquid and focus. 

## Conclusion

Portable vaporizes continue steadily to become better and even more accessible. A few years back you nearly needed a bank loan to invest in an excellent vaporizer, but nowadays there are a variety of affordable solutions obtainable.
