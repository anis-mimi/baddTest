While by using a manual vape might seem as an arduous task for some, for many folks, devoid of the restrictions that a battery brings is an awesome feature! 

If you've a portable vaping fanatic that loves taking their prized portable with them everywhere, having a manual vape signifies that you'll never have to worry about your battery functioning out again.

<!-- more -->

We've probably all been in the problem where we've rolled through to the spot with the loud, the papers, the filter, damn, a good grinder! Plus some damn fool decides to your investment lighter. It's a problem in the vaping environment too!

There's nothing worse than once you have your heart set on a program to carefully turn your vaporizer and start to see the electric battery level in a critical low.

Now, I find out that most vapes feature pass-through charging, but a genuine lightweight vaping fanatic doesn't wanna find out about no charger, hombre.

To begin I will probably begin by explaining just what a manual vape is, best? Above may be the Arizer Solo II (remaining) and the OG Arizer Solo (right) while they will be both amazing devices, neither of them can be a manual vape. 

Why did I include this photo then? Because there appears to be a major disparity between digital vapes, analog vapes (just like the OG Arizer Solo above), and manual vaporizers. 

The Arizer Solo II is an electronic vape, the OG Solo doesn't feature digital temperature control, and instead has a number of pre-programmed temperature settings, lumping it into the analog vape category.  

For this post I'm likely to review two of or best & most popular manual vaporizers; the Iolite Main Lightweight Vape and the DynaVap M 2018 Edition!

## Iolite Original Portable Vaporizer

Aside from traditional cup vaporizers that were similar to a crack pipe when compared to a herb vape, the Iolite Original Lightweight Vaporizer from Irish vaporizer veterans Ogglesby & Butler was first the initially known manual vape going to the market. 

The Iolite Original Lightweight Vape first hit marketplaces back 2008 to mass-acclaim. Ogglesby & Butler are actually camping source manufactures who assumed they've try their good luck with a you possess vape! Plus they killed it. 

With a large internal butane tank and economic-burner, you can find up to two hours of non-stop vaping time off of an individual tank of gas!

The Iolite Original's internal thermostat helps to keep the oven at a steady atomizing temp of 190'F (375'F). 

### Filling the Iolite

To load the Iolite Lightweight Vape, you must invert these devices and insert the finish of a pure butane gas can while pressing set for up to 30 seconds.

When the Iolite's internal vehicle's gas tank is whole it will emit a little burst of liquid gas, indicating that you need to remove the gas can's adapter and set the device down for a couple minutes to rest. 

While there is very little chance that you'll damage the device if you use it immediately after filling, I always find that it's great practice to keep it for a few minutes to settle in order that the gas may become used to its fresh pressurized atmosphere. 

### Packing the Iolite's Chamber

The Iolite Original Lightweight Vape has a chamber that's constructed from brass and aluminium, substances which are known to generate a number of the tastiest herb vapor around!

Both Storz & Bickel Crafty & Mighty have aluminium baking chambers, while the PUFFIT X utilizes brass. All three of the vaporizers are greatly around for his or her exquisite flavour and dense vapor. 

Ogglesby & Butler's Iolite Original is no different, utilizing a unique low-temp method of generate lots of immaculately pure, terpene-rich vapor. 

As the vapor produced is pretty light, and not necessarily incredibly dense, the flavor will there be in spades, causing this to be the perfect device for a herb connoisseur. 

### Heating the Iolite

Activating the Iolite Original's interior burner is really as simple while flicking a light change. Simply approach the food-grade plastic material dial from 0 to at least one 1 and await the crimson light to flicker. 

You will hear a faint 'whooshing' noise as the device's chamber gets hotter, and when the internal thermostat has realized that the doesn't is at the correct temperature for atomization, the sound will subside. 

Every few takes roughly the Iolite Original Vape will click back to heating mode to modify the temperature of the chamber within.

This means that you are absolve to leave your system running for extremely long periods without needing to worry about the herb inside becoming charred since it is only going to heat the chamber when needed.

The Iolite Main Gas-Powered Portable Vape has stood the test of time and sells will nonetheless to this day. It provides fantastic flavor, next-level portability, and total discreetness. 

It comes equipped with a fantastic nostalgic kit that's similar to its camping-supply-store heritage!

Included in the Iolite Original Kit is normally:
- 1 x Iolite Initial Gas-Powered Portable Vape
- 1 x Carrying Case 
- 1 x Moisture Condenser

## DynaVap M 2018 Edition Portable Vape

Among 2018's hottest new-release vapes may be the updated DynaVap M's Manual Vape. Sizzling hot off the hype of their 2017 release, DynaVap USA is right back at it with this new-and-improved vaping powerhouse!

The DynaVap M Portable Vaporizer is the price range, entry-level model in DynaVap USA's line of unique portable vapes, with a jaw-droppingly low price that is beyond value. 

Some vaporizers, now I'm not naming names, offer you products all vapor and a crappy taste for $250. The DynaVap is roughly 25 % of the price tag on many of these portables and is approximately as good as it gets in conditions of both flavor and density! 

Unlike the Iolite Original Lightweight Vape, the DynaVap M's chamber and the vast majority of its body system are made of stainless steel. 

The DynaVap M, pictured above left, includes a pretty unique chamber screen that really helps to limit herb particles from entering the vapor path.

Pictured left may be the DynaVap NonaVong-S, that is a more upmarket version with a wooden body system and titanium chamber.

Titanium is way better at retaining high temperature and provides a cleaner vapor, nonetheless it is comparatively expensive, pushing the price of the NonaVong-S over $100. 

### Packing the DynaVap M's Chamber

When packing your DynaVap's chamber you can use frequently whole herb or ground herb, but we definitely recommend utilizing a grinder to break the herb straight down as it will generate more vapor. 

The metal VapCap, pictured perfectly of the DynaVap's packed chamber, acts as sort of thermostat for your equipment chamber.

After the cap has been positioned over the chamber and heated to a specific extent, it'll click once or twice to let you know that your vape is preparing to use!

Heating the DynaVap M is really as simple as retaining the vape for a 45-degree position and striking it with the end of the light blue flame that the jet lighter produces. 

There are a couple of different guidelines that can be utilised to obtain additional flavor or a denser cloud of vapor, this is obviously a vape that takes a little getting used to, but once you've there you'll hardly ever want to place it down. 

The DynaVap M's certainly produces far more vapor than the Iolite Original portable vape, but as portable vapes go it's definitely not very discreet. 

Employing a DynaVap in public areas is only really practical when you've clear of judging eyes, as heating system the chamber up does appear to look just a little nefarious, especially in the cities were pipe-use is normally pretty prominent. 

Contained in VapeFuse's DynaVap M 2018 Edition Portable Vape Package is:
